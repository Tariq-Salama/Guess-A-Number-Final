/**
 * A simple Guess The Number game that will randomly generate an integer between 1 and 200.
 * If the user has guessed the correct number, the program will end with a message indicating 
 * how many guesses it took to get the right answer and a message that is determined by how many 
 * guesses it takes them to get the right answer. If the user guesses incorrectly, the program should 
 * respond with a message that the user has guessed either "too high" or "too low" and let them guess again.
